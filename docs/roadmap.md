# Viper v2.0 Implementation Roadmap

## Guiding Principles
- Deliver a production-grade experience end-to-end; no throwaway scaffolding.
- Prioritize deterministic automation; every workflow must be reproducible by `viper setup` and the REST APIs.
- Cloud Hypervisor, static networking, and the embedded SQLite store are non-negotiable foundations.
- Treat the orchestration engine as the source of truth; all other surfaces (CLI, TUI, MCP, AG-UI) consume its APIs.
- Keep surface area focused: fewer features executed impeccably over breadth with compromise.

## Phase 0 – Environment & Project Foundations
- ✅ Repository structure (server, agent, cli, image build, installer) with Go modules and shared tooling in place.
- ✅ Make targets and baseline lint/test scripts defined.
- 📄 Contribution, coding conventions, and CI scaffolding still to be authored.

## Phase 1 – Orchestrator Core (viper-server)
- Implement embedded SQLite schema migrations (`vms`, `ip_allocations`, `workloads`, `plugins`).
- Build orchestration services: IP leasing, MAC generation, VM lifecycle, child-process supervision.
- Expose REST API v1 (VM CRUD, IP pool introspection, health, agent proxy).
- Integrate event bus feeding REST responses, MCP, AG-UI, and TUI.

## Phase 2 – Image Pipeline & In-VM Stack
- Create Docker-to-initramfs Make pipeline producing kernel + initramfs artifacts.
- Implement `/bin/viper-init` (mounts, parse cmdline, static networking, exec `viper-agent`).
- Build `viper-agent` Go service wrapping chromedp/headless-shell with REST+CDP proxy surfaces.
- Deliver artifact publishing flow consumable by orchestrator and installer.

## Phase 3 – Client Surfaces
- Standard CLI (Cobra) covering orchestrator operations, profile management, artifact retrieval.
- TUI (Bubble Tea) with live dashboards, command palette, websocket-driven updates.
- Browser proxy command bridging CDP WebSocket to localhost.

## Phase 4 – AI-Native Protocols
- MCP endpoint mapping commands -> orchestrator engine with capabilities discovery.
- AG-UI WebSocket emitter streaming orchestrator, agent, and workload events.

## Phase 5 – Installer & Setup Experience
- Author `install.viper.dev` bootstrapper and `viper setup` automation.
- Implement host validation, dependency installation, bridge/NAT setup, systemd service management.
- Provide rollback/recovery and diagnostics commands.

## Phase 6 – Hardening & Release Readiness
- Comprehensive integration tests (VM lifecycle, agent flows, networking, MCP/AG-UI).
- Load/chaos testing for orchestrator stability.
- Security review: privilege boundaries, input validation, TLS/auth (scope TBD).
- Documentation polish: operator guide, admin manual, API references.

## Dependencies & Sequencing Notes
- Orchestrator schema must stabilize before CLI/TUI client development.
- Image pipeline artifacts are prerequisites for end-to-end VM lifecycle tests.
- Event bus contract must be defined ahead of TUI and AG-UI work to avoid rework.
- Installer depends on orchestrator + image artifact availability + systemd unit definitions.

## Immediate Next Actions (Sprint 1)
1. ✅ Implement typed repositories for VMs and IP allocations atop the SQLite store.
2. ✅ Flesh out orchestrator engine interfaces, including IP lease workflow, Cloud Hypervisor launch integration, and initial crash monitoring.
3. Start authoring ADRs covering networking model, process supervision (event emission, retries), and event bus contract.
4. Introduce CI placeholder (lint/test) and contribution guidelines.
5. Design REST authentication/authorization model and CLI alignment.
