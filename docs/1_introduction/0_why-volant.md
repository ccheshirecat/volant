# Why Volant

Volant treats microVMs as firstâ€‘class runtimes: real kernels, deterministic networking, and a tiny control plane. You get the security of VMs with the ergonomics of containers.

Use it when you need:
- Hardware isolation without orchestration sprawl
- Predictable networking with static IPs
- Two paths for workloads: fastest boot via initramfs or compatibility via OCI rootfs
- A clear, auditable contract between control plane and guest
